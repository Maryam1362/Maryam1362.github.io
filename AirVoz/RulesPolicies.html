<h2>Airvoz rules and policies</h2>
<p>We may revise these Rules from time to time; the most current version will always be at airvoz.com/rules.</p>

<article>Our goal is to provide a service that allows you to discover and receive messages from your surroundings as well as to share your content with others in different locations. We respect the ownership of the content that users share and each user is responsible for the content he or she provides as well as any physical products and actions he or she utilizes to convey the content. Because of these principles, we do not actively monitor and will not censor user content or distribution methods, except in limited circumstances described below.</article>

<h2>Boundaries and Use of Airvoz</h2>
<article>In order to provide the Airvoz service and the ability to communicate and stay connected with others, there are some limitations on the type of content that can be published with Airvoz. These limitations comply with legal requirements and make Airvoz a better experience for all. We may need to change these rules from time to time and reserve the right to do so. Please check back here to see the latest.</article>

Mass account creation may result in suspension of all related accounts. Please note that any violation of the Airvoz Rules is cause for permanent suspension of all accounts.</article>

<article>Targeted Abuse: You may not engage in targeted abuse or harassment. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be targeted abuse or harassment are:</article>
<ul>

<li>if the sole purpose of your account is to send abusive messages to others;</li>

<li>if the reported behavior is one-sided or includes threats</li>
</ul>

<li>Spam: You may not use the Airvoz service for the purpose of spamming anyone. What constitutes “spamming” will evolve as we respond to new tricks and tactics by spammers. Some of the factors that we take into account when determining what conduct is considered to be spamming are:</li>

<li>If a large number of people are blocking you;</li>

<li>If a large number of spam complaints have been filed against you;</li>

<li>If you post duplicate content over multiple accounts;</li>

</ul>

<li>Pornography: You may not use obscene or pornographic images in either your profile photo, header photo, or user background or any parts of the content you are sharing using Airvoz.

</ul>
